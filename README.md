🎮 #Smart Tic-Tac-Toe vs AI


Play Tic-Tac-Toe directly in your browser against a smart AI that actually uses strategy — not random moves.
Built with Python, Gradio, and a touch of game theory.



✨ #Features
✅ Play as ❌, AI plays as ⭕

✅ AI tries to win or block you intelligently

✅ Clear, emoji-based board in your browser

✅ No installation needed if deployed (or easy to run locally)

✅ Built entirely in Python + Gradio

Tries to win if it can on this move

Otherwise blocks you if you’re about to win

Otherwise plays the best available spot
